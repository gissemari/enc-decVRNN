The three phases: training, validaiton and sample call forward() the difference is that:
- training provides a drop_out probability that I assume is to take into account or not the previous predicted word. Not actually, is to convert to zeroes some of the input, according to that probability. So it is not the same to take the previous predicted.
- Sample and validation have a drop_out of 0, I guess it means that the decoder_input are not taken into account and it's pure generation
- The difference between validation and sample is that in validation we still have the input for the encoder. However, in the sampling we no longer have the input for the encoder

- Just added the softmax calculation in the VALIDATION stage.
- Planning to add another validation that does the prediction step by step (as in sample) to see the real quality

Combining VRNN-PYTORCH.
- Adding the VRNN model as model/decoderVRNN.py
- Some adjustments needed to be done in order to make CUDA owk in SPIEDIE. Basically as now we have a lot of partial results in VRNN, we were running out of memory in GPU mode. We detach() the results we were appending and vual√°.

- Now we are copying the test file from paraphrase generation to this repository that did not have it. Moving also the beam_search files
